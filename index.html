            New Delhi: The Congress on Saturday held protests in many states
            against fresh notices from the income tax department for payment of
            Rs 1,823 crore and said it would not be intimidated by the Centre's
            "tax terrorism", but the BJP accused the opposition party of
            misleading the country after committing "tax fraud" and asserted
            that no one is above law.

          <p>
            Owl be damned! New research finds that being a night owl is bad for
            your mental health. Going to bed by 1 a.m. can lower your risk of
            developing mental and behavioral conditions such as depression and
            anxiety, according to a study published last month in the journal
            Psychiatry Research. Researchers compared the preferred sleep
            timing, known as chronotype, with the actual sleep behavior of
            nearly 74,000 UK adults.
