            Mitchell Starc opens up on Rohit Sharma’s brutal assault vs
            Australia in T20 World Cup: ‘I bowled 5 bad balls, he hit them all
            for six’

            Among the crucial performances for India on their road to the T20
            World Cup win was captain Rohit Sharma’s blistering knock of 92
            against Australia in the Super-8. An innings that saw Rohit take
            Mitchell Starc to the cleaners for 29 runs in one over. Opening up
            on the match for the first time, Starc has shared what he made of
            the Indian skipper. “I’ve played a lot against him. He had a good
            tournament, especially in our game. I think he targeted that wind in
            St. Lucia as well. If you look at the runs from each end, one end
            went for a lot more than the other. I bowled from that end. I bowled
            five bad balls and he hit them all for six,” the Aussie pacer said
            on the Willow Talk Cricket podcast.

            Jasmine Paolini reached her second consecutive Grand Slam final with
            a 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (8) victory over unseeded Donna Vekic at Wimbledon
            on Thursday in a rollicking match that lasted 2 hours, 51 minutes,
            making it the tournament's longest women's semifinal on record.
            Paolini kept coming back after dropping the opening set, after being
            two games from defeat at 4-all in the second, after twice trailing
            by a break in the third at 3-1 and 4-3.
